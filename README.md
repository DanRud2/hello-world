Just getting started with GitHub!

Excited to get into GitHub via FreeCodeCamp. Testing the waters of web development.

Going to be using GitHub for my Android Studio projects. So, here I am relearnig how to commit changes and stuff. 
Hopefully it isn't too hard to integrate GitHub into my Android Studio installation!
